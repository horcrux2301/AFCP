`Note:- The package has been fairly tested for MacOS and Linux. However Windows users might face some issues. Please open one in the repo if you do.`.

**The notification feature is not currently supported for windows. I don't have access to a machine right now to test the code for windows, but you can expect an update for windows in a couple of days.**

## Installation

Install package either by running `apm install afcp` from the terminal or by searching in the Install menu from Atom.

You will also need to install the following to use the package properly.

Linux -

1. [Install gcc](https://gist.github.com/application2000/73fd6f4bf1be6600a2cf9f56315a2d91)

MacOS-

1. Install gcc. This can be done by installing Xcode or Command Line Developer Tools.

Windows -

1. Install MinGW.



## Usage

**Add the directory locations**
---

Add directory locations for each site i.e where you want the folder for the problems to be created.

An example location can look like this:- `/Users/harshkhajuria/Desktop/TEST/` .

**Important. Don't forget to add a `/`(for MacOS and Linux) or `\` (for Windows) at the end of the location.**

You can drag and drop the folder into terminal to get the paths

~~`coreutils` is used to make sure that your code doesn't goes into an infinite loop. The time limit right now is `5 seconds` which can be edited from the setting menu.~~ (There is no need to install `coreutils` since version `0.8.18`).

**To fetch the problems and testcases**
---

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/HRwTUOT.png)

Press `alt+control+k` to open the pane. Check the site radio button and put the contest code into the input field. Press `Fetch Data` .

A folder will be created for each of the problems with their test cases in the directory that you specify in the settings menu.

*In order to close the pane press again `ctrl+alt+k`*

**To compile and create output files**
---

Press `alt+control+c` to compile. One output file will be generated for each and every file that starts with `input` in the folder where `.cpp` file is.

In order to create your own test cases create a input*.txt file in the same directory of the problem replacing * with a integer.
Corresponding output file can be generated by pressing `alt+control+c` again.

Since version `0.8.18`, I have also added notifications based on the diffs generated between `output*.txt` and `myOutput*.txt`. 

![Drag and drop](https://i.imgur.com/eUtCzQ7.gif)

*If no corresponding file is found either for `output` or `myOutput` a notification will be added and only time taken for the execution will be shown.*

**To see diffs**
---

Press `alt+control+p` to bring out a right pane to see the diffs generated between corresponding files. To close the pane press `alt+control+o`.

**To change gcc version and add additional flags while compiling**
---
Update the `Default GCC` in the settings menu with the gcc version of your choice. For example if you use homebrew to install g++-4.9 then simply update the settings to use `g++-4.9`.

Update the `GCC Options` in the settings menu to add additional flags while compiling. For eg:- `-std=c++14`

**To change the Time Limit**
---
Update the `Time Limit ` in the settings menu (in seconds).
